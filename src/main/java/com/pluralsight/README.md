# Accounting Ledger App 

### Author - Mercy Evans 
This project stressed me out, but I learned a lot and had fun building it from scratch!

- **This app is for tracking deposits and payments**

## Features:
1. Adding a deposit
2. Making payment
3. Store transactions
4. Display transactions
5. Reports Menu that generates:
        -Month to date
        - Previous month
        - Year to date
        - Previous Year
        - Search by Vendor
6. Interactive Home screen - Navigate using menu options


## Classes:
1. Main
    - Display menus
    - Takes user input
    - Creates transaction objects
    - Stores transactions in an arraylist
    - Saves to and reads from transactions.csv
   
2. Transaction
    - Represents one transaction record
    - Stores: 
            - date, time, description, vendor, amount
    - formats itself as a CSV line so you can save it easily

## How It Works

- When the app starts, it loads all transactions from transactions.csv.

- Users interact through a text-based menu (Deposit, Payment, Ledger, Reports, Exit).

- Each new transaction is written to both memory and the CSV file.

- Sorting and filters are handled directly in memory for faster access.

## Challenges & Solutions

- Formatting the time - used 'DateTimeFormatter', & import the class.

- Deciding on where to store the transactions - created an array list in the main to avoid reading the file every time. Modified my classes

- Transaction list starts empty when running view ledger even if transactions.csv has data - added a method to load existing transactions from CSV into memory

- Transactions not loading from file - added a method to load CSV data into the arraylist 

- Sorting newest to oldest - used Comparable and collections.sort.

- Differentiating payments and deposits - made payments negative using -Math.abs(amount)

## Lessons Learned

- Breaking a project into smaller, reusable classes (Main and Transaction)

- Saw how methods and constructors work together to make code more organized and readable

- Learned to test small pieces of code often instead of waiting until the end

- Learned a lot of new concepts and how to apply them

- Getting the file reading/writing to work correctly with the CSV file â€” seeing data save and load felt like a big win.

- Building something from scratch that uses real programming logic

## Interesting Code

- Sorting transactions by newest first - ledger always displays the most recent deposits and payments at the top.
```java
//sorting newest first
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Transaction otherTransaction) {
        LocalDateTime thisDateTime = LocalDateTime.of(this.date, this.time);
        LocalDateTime otherDateTime = LocalDateTime.of(otherTransaction.getDate(), otherTransaction.getTime());
        return otherDateTime.compareTo(thisDateTime);
    }

```
